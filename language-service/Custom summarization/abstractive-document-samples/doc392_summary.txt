Microsoft's Tech for Social Impact, a key part of Microsoft Philanthropies, has been inspired by the resilience and commitment of the nonprofits they support. In fiscal year 2021, Microsoft provided $2.5 billion in technology grants and discounts to 295,000 nonprofits, 45,000 more than last year. Beginning in April 2022, Microsoft is shifting to a cloud-first grant program to ensure that nonprofits of every size in every part of the globe have access to the world-class cloud technology they need to accelerate the work they are doing to accomplish their missions. To help protect nonprofits against the growing threat of cyberattacks, the AccountGuard for Nonprofits program will be made available to eligible organizations at no additional cost. Microsoft will continue to provide on-premises software to nonprofits at a discount of up to 75% through Microsoft partners. Microsoft is also expanding its training programs that help nonprofits get the most out of the tools and technologies they provide.
