Lufthansa CityLine, a subsidiary of Lufthansa, is using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the turnaround process for its planes. The airline relies on manual timestamps to understand when each step of the turnaround process starts and ends and uses that manual timestamp data to glean insights on where to make adjustments for faster, leaner turnarounds. The airline partnered with zeroG, a Lufthansa Group consulting company, to accelerate the impact of AI in operational and commercial processes at airlines around the world. The airline partnered With Azure Video Analyzer, a new offering from Microsoft that combines capabilities from Live Video Analytics and Azure Video Indexer, to generate automatic timestamps from the video feeds and issues alerts when the turnaround goes off script. Microsoft also highlighted Azure Applied AI Services, which are built on top of AI models at the core of Azure AI products and services. The goal with Azure Applied AI Services is to provide a bit more packaging and structure to really accelerate the development of AI solutions for common business processes.
