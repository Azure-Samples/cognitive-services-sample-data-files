1102,0,Donald Erie,derie,don@example.com,9:04 AM,shipping,Insufficient packaging,"I ordered three widgets last week and just received them. I am VERY disappointed in the way they were packed. The box was only about two thirds full of packing peanuts and the widgets were not individually wrapped. As a result they were able to bump up against each other while in transit. The display on one doesn't work at all and the other two are quite scratched up (look like they have been in service for years) though they do work fine. I have always been satisifed with your service and trust you will make this right, but I suggest you look into how you are packing these items. You will have a lot of unhappy customers otherwise.",10,3

If you weren't the only company I've been able to find that even has these items, I would have stopped ordering from you a long time ago. I order weekly and it seems like at least once a month my order has some kind of foul-up. Waiting for the order to be corrected would set my business back so I need to keep extra on hand just in case. Not fair for me to have to carry extra inventory to make up for YOUR screw-ups! Hire someone who can tell the difference between a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit. If anyone reading this knows of another source please let me know.",5,10

And they're a steal, too; I've paid twice your asking price for garombles that weren't nearly as smooth in operation. Free ground delivery was a plus (the overnight shipping seems a little spendy though). We'll see how these actually hold up, but so far I'm sold!",15,2

(Or is it whatchamacallits you need?) I have found Contoso Supply to have thingamabobs but not reliably. Maybe if they started getting more orders for them this would improve.",5,0

1109,0,Susan Colorado,susanc,suecol@example.com,1:15 PM,techsupport,Problems with retro-encabulator,"Hi folks. According to your encabulator brochure, the hydrocoptic marzlevanes are supposed to prevent side fumbling. In fact, I bought your retro-encabulator because of your claims that it was highly resistant to this problem. However, I'm seeing a lot of side fumbling anyway. Am I doing something wrong or do I have a defective unit?",19,7

1113,1109,Fabrikam Support,fsupport,support@fabrikam.com,3:16 PM,techsupport,Re: Problems with retro-encabulator,"Susan, the hydrocoptic marzlevanes MUST be fitted properly to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft to prevent side fumbling. Please see page 42 of the manual for an illustration of proper fitment. Also, as mentioned on page 65, after the 24-hour break-in period, you will probably want to re-adjust the marzlevanes for optimum performance. Remember, our standard warranty includes one complimentary service call in the first week to resolve setup issues. If you continue to have trouble, don't hesitate to use it! Our technician will certainly be able to diagnose side-fumbling issues, and, should your encabulator prove defective (it does rarely happen) will install a replacement.",2,7
1114,1109,Roy Ontario,royo,roy_it@example.com,3:29 PM,techsupport,Re: Problems with retro-encabulator,Have you tried turning it off and back on again? The encabulator runs a self-calibration at each power-up that may help reduce side fumbling.,31,5

Our systems are supposed to notice these kinds of patterns and flag them for us to review. Obviously they failed to do so in your case (not giving excuses, just offering an explanation). Anyway, I've given your account VIP status which means every order you place will receive additional review to make sure it is filled correctly Also, you will receive free expedited shipping for all your future orders. I've overnighted you the correct items from your most recent order. - James",27,4

I think gray or black would be useful, particularly in a matte finish. Your gizmos are only one small part of our contraption, which has a rather sedate design, and they really clash. We keep using them because they're the most reliable we've found, but our customers keep asking why they're like that! We considered repainting them, but that's a LOT of work considering the intricacy of their design.",35,19
