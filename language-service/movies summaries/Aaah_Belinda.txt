Serap, a young actress with a strong, lively personality and a special dislike for middle-class family life, takes part in a TV-commercial for a recently marketed shampoo, "Belinda". She plays the role of a typical housewife called Naciye. During one of the rehearsals, she suddenly finds that the stage has disappeared, the crew has vanished and all the elements of the script have become real. Now she is Naciye. No one around recognizes her as Serap anymore. Even worse, her family thinks that she is suffering from depression, while Serap desperately tries to prove otherwise.
