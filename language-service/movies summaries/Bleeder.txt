The film follows the friends Leo and Lenny, who lives in NÃ¸rrebro, a working class neighborhood in Copenhagen. Leo lives in a rundown apartment with his girlfriend Louise. Lenny is a shy film expert who suffers from avoidant personality disorder and works with his and Leo's mutual friend Kitjo in a videostore that rents out cultfilms and art films as well as a huge collection of pornographic films. When Leo finds out, that Louise is pregnant, and wants to keep the baby, he becomes more and more aggresive. In despair, he hits Louise, and is threatned by her brother, Louis. When it happens again, Louise looses the baby. Louis takes a gruesome revenge by injecting HIV infected blood into Leo's body. Leo retaliates in a equally gruesome manner, shooting Louis in the stomach, then shooting off his own hand and letting the blood drip into Louis' wound. Leo then commits suicide. As a subplot, we follow Lenny, who is trying to build a relationship to Lea, a girl that works in a local grill bar. Lenny asks Lea out to see a movie, but chickens out. They both seem shy towards each other, and have trouble communicating. When Lenny asks her again, she is hesistant, but eventually says yes.
