A Japanese businessman sees a woman being groped in a crowded Tokyo subway. He is interested to see how she would rather moan silently, involuntary orgasm than let people know she is being groped. When he is transferred to Los Angeles, the Japanese businessman tries to imitate what he saw by groping who happens to be Lt. Crowe 's daughter. But unlike in Japan, the American woman raises a commotion and makes him run away in embarrassment. Meanwhile, the daughter of the same Japanese businessman is kidnapped into a child prostitution ring led by the infamous 'Pimp-King' Duke. Lt. Crowe, who claims the Japanese are in the process of buying Los Angeles, is recruited to find the daughter. Lt. Crowe and his partner indeed find the daughter, and Lt. Crowe changes his opinions about the Japanese when the Japanese businessman and his wife visit his house bearing gifts. Lt. Crowe's daughter recognizes the Japanese businessman but says nothing. Back at home, the Japanese businessman's daughter cannot cope with what happened to her back in the ring, and commits suicide by an overdose. Lt. Crowe and his partner thus go to find Duke by any means necessary. In the ensuing fight, Duke manages to kill Lt. Crowe's partner, but &ndash; not knowing how to swim &ndash; almost drowns in the process of the fight. Lt. Crowe does answer his calls for help, but arranges for the small, long haired pimp to serve his prison sentence in a particularly harsh environment with multiple muscular, threatening inmates, all of whom make clear their desire to rape him. Lt. Crowe personally escorts the Duke to his cell, then walks away smiling. As Duke screams after him in petrified rage, Crowe looks back and says, "Now that's justice."
