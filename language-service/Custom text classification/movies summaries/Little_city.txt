Adam, a San Francisco-based artist who works as a cab driver on the side, is having a hard time committing to his girlfriend, Nina. She wants to take their relationship to the next level, but he hasn't really gotten over his ex-girlfriend, Kate, who left him for another woman and is reluctant to move forward with Nina because he's still hanging on to the idea that one day Kate will come back to him. Feeling neglected, Nina breaks up with Adam and starts seeing Kevin, a womanizing bartender who is also Adam's best friend. Meanwhile Rebecca, the new girl in town, gets a job in Kevin's bar and begins an affair with Anne, the woman Kate left Adam for. Tired of her infidelities, Kate breaks up with Anne and returns to Adam. However she soon realises that she's not in love with him anymore and breaks up with him for good. Rebecca soon tires of Anne and breaks off their affair. One day she meets Adam, who is finally attempting to move on from Kate once and for all, and they go out on a date. Nina and Kevin's fling turns into something deeper when she finds out that she's pregnant, an event that strains Adam's friendship with Kevin and threatens to ruin his budding relationship with Rebecca before it has a chance to begin.
