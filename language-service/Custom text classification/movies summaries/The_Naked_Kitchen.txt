Ahn Mo-rae and Han Sang-in have been friends since childhood. He didn't mind that she followed him around, calling him hyung or Big Brother , and their marital relationship is an odd but appealing mix of hot sex and best buddies. The day of their wedding anniversary is pretty eventful. Mo-rae  cooks breakfast, serving it on their best china, hoping to get Sang-in  into the mood for love before he goes to work. Sang-in quits his high-end stockbroker job so that he can devote himself to his lifelong dream of running a fancy restaurant. While shopping for an anniversary gift for Sang-in, Mo-rae sneaks into a closed gallery, where she encounters another illicit visitor -- a very handsome young man with whom she hides when the gallery owner turns up. Mo-rae, overcome by heat and dizziness, has a sudden sexual encounter with the stranger, who then vanishes. She confesses the incident to her husband, downplaying it both to him and to herself. Then Sang-in tells Mo-rae over dinner that he's expecting a mentor to help him plan the menu for his dream restaurant: a brilliant young French-Korean chef who will arrive that evening. Park Du-re , the French-Korean mentor, turns out to be Mo-rae's stranger, who now will be staying with the young couple, sleeping in the room that had belonged to Sang-in's late mother. With her husband blissfully unaware of Du-reâ€™s identity, he encourages Mo-rae to get along with him. Mo-rae is powerfully drawn to the seductive Du-re while Sang-in gets cooking lessons from him, leading the poor woman to somewhat of a crisis as she tries to decide what her heart really wants.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}{{cite web}}
