Archie Andrews, fifteen years after graduating from Riverdale High, has become a successful lawyer and is getting ready to marry his fiancée, Pam, and move to "the big city." Before doing that, however, he returns home to Riverdale for his high school reunion. Archie and company are all now in their early thirties, with the trials and tribulations one might expect to have happened to such a group over the years: *Betty, a grade school teacher, is constantly bossed around by her crummy boyfriend, Robert. *Veronica, having lived in France since graduation, has been married  four times. *Jughead, now a psychiatrist, is also a divorcé with a son, Jordan. Jughead carries emotional baggage that manifests itself in a terrible fear of women.  This is played for laughs at the end when at the reunion it turns out that Big Ethel is no longer the gangly, awkward teenager she once was but is now a striking beauty. *Moose and Midge have gotten married and become chiropractors. They also have a son, Max, who hits it off with Jordan. When Archie sees Betty and Veronica for the first time in fifteen years, all his old feelings for them come flooding back, threatening his engagement—and it doesn't help that the girls renew their pursuit of Archie, heedless of the fact that he has a fiancée. Meanwhile, Archie also tries to keep gym owner Reggie, helped along by an uncharacteristically menacing Mr. Lodge, from evicting Pop Tate from his soda shop. Archie ultimately saves the Chock'lit Shoppe, though he loses Pam in the bargain, and decides to stay in Riverdale.
