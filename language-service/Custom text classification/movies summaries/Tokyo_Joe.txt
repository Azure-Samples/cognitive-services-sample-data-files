She has remarried, to American diplomat Mark Landis , and has a seven-year-old child, Joe's daughter Anya . Barrett starts up an air freight business. One of his customers, underworld boss Baron Kimura , wants him to smuggle war criminals into the country in order to organize an anti-American Communist movement. When he balks, Kimura kidnaps Anya.
