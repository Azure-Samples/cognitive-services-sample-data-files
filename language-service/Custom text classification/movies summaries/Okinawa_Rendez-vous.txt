Jimmy Tong  is an expert blackmailer and thief who specialises in white-collar crimes. With his side-kick , Jimmy steals a personal diary belonging to a Yakuza leader Ken Sato  intending to use its details as a platform for blackmailing and to extort money. Sato agreed to the uneasy deal and made preparations to pay Jimmy his exorbitant demands only for Sato's girlfriend Jenny  to betray him and make off with the money to Okinawa. Elsewhere, Dat Lo  was vacationing with his girlfriend  and another jilted girl  in Okinawa , but stumbles into Jimmy whom he had little problems recognising as an international crook. From here onwards, Dat set aside his irrelevant plans to dump his companions and sought to devise a plan to entrap and to subsequently arrest Jimmy. Dat tried to convince Jimmy as an accomplice to a new bank heist of which Jimmy needed little persuasion. However, Jenny comes into the frame and before long, both Jimmy and Dat fell in love with her.
