Kempe Gowda is a sub-inspector in a dusty village of Rona in Hubli, his native, where he is adored. Armugam, a notorious criminal, is brought down to his knees at the local police station. Their egos clash and Armugam, who has never had to face an opposition before, decides to teach Gowda a lesson. He is transferred to Bengaluru, where Amugam's writ runs large. As the cop begins to unearth Armugam's misdeeds, he realises that he is up against a real challenge. This kalla-police saga is one that is full of ferocious dialogues and gravity-defying stunts. Even the love story between Sudeep and Ragini lightens the mood in between. Ashok, Girish Karnad and Thara add the family emotions to this narrative. Surprisingly, it is the comedy track of Sharan that pales in comparison. When it comes to acting, Sudeep and Ravi Shankar compete with each other. The casting of the other actors, with a few dialogues, is almost perfect. Thara as Ragini's mother is just an example. Arjun comes up with some good songs, but it is his background score that gives the film an extra zing. This is Krishna's first film as cinematographer in an action genre. It is as impressive as the shots he captures of waterfalls and verdant fields. Arun Sagar's artwork is excellent. The outdoor shrine of Anjaneya, recasting a village in Mandya as the one in AP and the props in the song Hale Radio, are commendable. Newcomer Vishwa shows ample talent in editing. So do the duo of Anil and Shreekanth in dialogue writing. Kempe Gowda has nothing to do with the founder of Bangalore though he is remembered in a song. Sudeep is transferred to the Magadi Road police station in the film. The powerful part of the movie is Force which made the movie racier than the original movie http://www.sify.com/movies/sudeep-raagini-in-kempe-gowda-imagegallery-kannada-ldirGlfdgfd.html?html=5
