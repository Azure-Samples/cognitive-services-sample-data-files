Robin Shea is a mischief-causing temptress, a rock-star wannabe who will do anything to escape the confines of a New Mexico prison. She meets a young man named Billy Moran who is doing some manual labor at the prison. After a brief tryst within minutes of having met, she persuades Billy to marry her. Billy's responsible, serious demeanor is a sharp contrast to Robin's wild-child nature. She doesn't want a relationship. She is only interested in furthering a musical career any way she can. A politician, James Tiernan, had previously picked up Robin during a jailbreak and drove her back to the prison. He risks his chances of being elected governor on his ability to use Robin as a poster child for successful prison reform. In the meantime, Robin tries to teach Billy how to properly relate to women as he tries to teach her how to be a wife and mother. In effect, they learn from each other how to become better human beings.
