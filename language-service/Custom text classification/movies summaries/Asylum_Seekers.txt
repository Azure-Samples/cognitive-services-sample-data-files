Six introverted individuals, bored with their lives and trying to escape their daily routine, attempt to find a radical solution to their boredom by getting themselves admitted into a psychiatric hospital. Among these individuals are: Maud , a bored trophy wife who feels trapped in a loveless marriage; Antoine , a sex-obsessed virgin; Alice , a woman whose only enjoyment comes from computers; Miranda , a paranoid exhibitionist whose inhibitions make her dislike being the center of attention; Paul , a fanatical right-wing conspiracy theorist; and Alan , an androgynous rapper. Upon arriving to the asylum, the six individuals are informed that there is only room for one person in the hospital. Nurse Milly  informs the individuals that they will now have to compete for the only remaining spot in the asylum. The nurse proceeds to administer tests and contests and whomever she deems to be the craziest and most insane will be declared the winner and will be committed into the institution. The competition and everything in the institution is always watched over and supervised by an unseen character known only as "The Beard".
