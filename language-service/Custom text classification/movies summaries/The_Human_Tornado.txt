After coming off a successful comedy tour, Dolemite throws a get-together at his mansion, there he announces that he is to offer his mansion to the person that started a drive for a new boys' home, then is rudely interrupted by the local sheriff and his deputies because they're a group of black people having a party, thus causing trouble. Turns out the Sheriff's wife is offering Dolemite money for sexual services. When the sheriff catches them red handed, he promptly shoots his wife. Dolemite and his friends kidnap a young man and his car and decide head to California where he is to meet Queen Bee, only to find out that the local mob man, Joe Cavaletti kidnapped two of her girls and forced her to close down her joint and work for him. Dolemite must rescue Queen Bee, her girls and teach the grease balls a lesson all the while being chased by his hometown's sheriff for the murder of his wife he pinned on him. The final scenes are similar to much of the era's kung fu scenes along with the expected added sound effects, and a fight with none other than the "Central American Nunchuck champion".
