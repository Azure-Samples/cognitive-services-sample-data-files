The vignettes include: * An accountant  undergoing a therapy session in the office of a passive-aggressive psychologist . * Two immigrants from India on security detail for a visiting dignitary. * An ambitious pastry chef  preparing a professional pitch that she hopes will make her the reigning doyenne of New York's competitive cake scene. * A Brooklyn housewife  fixes her husband's dinner and then sits at the kitchen table making collages out of old magazines while her husband sits on the balcony, smoking a cigarette. * Allison & David Burbage (Judy Greer, [[Thomas McCarthy  struggle to keep their marriage together while coping with their increasingly difficult and strangely self-possessed 10-year-old son.
