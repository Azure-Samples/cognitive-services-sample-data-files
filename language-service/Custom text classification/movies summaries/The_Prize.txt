The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to Andrew Craig , who seems to be more interested in women and drinking than writing. When he arrives in Stockholm for the award ceremony, he is delighted to find that the Swedish Foreign Department has sent the beautiful Inger Lisa Andersson  as his personal chaperone. When Craig arrives at his hotel, he is introduced to another laureate, Dr. Max Stratman , a famous German-American physicist, who is accompanied by his niece Emily . When Craig meets Stratman for the second time, at a press conference, Stratman acts as if they had never met before and also displays a change in personality, despising photographs and being less talkative. Craig then, with no time to further talk to Dr. Stratman, has to give his interview, and in short succession admits to suffering from writer's block for years, having not even started his highly anticipated next novel, Return to Carthage, and having written pulp detective stories to pay the rent. He even suggests that he may have lost his talent. Asked for an example of developing a detective story, he suggests the possibility that Stratman may be an impostor. The Nobel laureates for chemistry, Dr. Denise Marceau  and Dr. Claude Marceau , as well as his "private" secretary, Monique Souvir  are also staying at the hotel. So are Dr. Carlo Farelli  and Dr. John Garrett ([[Kevin McCarthy , the laureates for medicine. As events progress toward the prize ceremony, Craig realizes that his offhand suggestion that Stratman is an impostor is actually the truth, and pursues the case. Unfortunately, his adversaries are able to stay one move ahead of him and cover their tracks, and due to Craig's reputation of heavy drinking and fiction writing, nobody believes him.
